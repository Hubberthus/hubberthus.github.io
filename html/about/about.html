<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
	My name is Norbert Fekete (Hubberthus).
</p>
<p>
	I'm a programmer who happens to like playing with microcontrollers. I'm not connected to anyone developing the microcontrollers and boards for them. This page is just one of my hobby projects.
</p>

<h3>About the website</h3>
<p>
	I started to do all this for myself, but decided to share it with the community. Maybe it can help out others as well.
	With the help of this website, hopefully the managing of pinout for boards will be easier:
</p>
<p>
	You can choose which functionalities/interfaces you would like to have, set up modes, pin positions where applicabe, and the result will be shown in a WYSIWYG mode.
	Conflicting pin settings can be visually avoided, and you can see exactly which pin will be used for which functionality.
</p>
<p>
	There is a project page for this at: <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/20562-mcu-pin-setup">Hackaday.io</a>
</p>
<p>
	The source code can be browsed here: <a href="https://github.com/Hubberthus/hubberthus.github.io">https://github.com/Hubberthus/hubberthus.github.io</a>

<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>
	Before I bought my first <a href="https://espressif.com/">ESP32 (created by Espressif Inc.)</a> module, I looked deep into the documentation, and a bit into the source of the development framework. 
</p>
<p>
	At first I was completely blown away by its rich contents. Then I realized that setting up a project for this chip will be quite a challenge.
	It has so many interfaces with overlapping pins, plus it has the GPIO matrix which is a powerful tool. 
</p>
<p>
	I was scratching my head, how to choose the right pinout settings for my projects?
	What if I would like to change somethig a bit and that needed changing the whole setup? Also, I need to be aware of the input-only pins, and any conflicts I can cause.
</p>
<p>
	And this is why I started making this little tool. 
</p>
<hr>
<h4>Why a website?</h4>
<p>
	It is kind of cross-platform and you don't need to download anything. Just have a recent browser, select your module, and start playing with pin settings. 
</p>
<hr>
<h4>The functionality .... is missing/wrong!</h4>
<p>
	I try to do my best, according to the documentation and my knowledge of things. There are many holes and messed up stuff. I hope I'll get some help to get this as accurate as it can be.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>The module ... is missing!</h4>
<p>
	Same as the above. Trying to do my best in adding more and more modules so everybody can setup according to what they have.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>I can do an invalid setup!</h4>
<p>
	Sanity check is on the TODO list. I will try to do it as fast as I can.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>I would like to save what I've done. Why is it resetting always?</h4>
<p>
	Save/load functionality is also on the TODO list. A simple cookie-based quicksave/quickload could be done, also the active project JSON could be downloaded/uploaded.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>What is the idea about the "code flavor" stuff?</h4>
<p>
	Based on the setup, the tool can create a virtual layer, a generated code. It has many potential in it. One of them is the "code flavor" when you can select a coding style you prefer.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>Is there a documentation about this if I wanted to add e.g. a board or an MCU core?</h4>
<p>
	For now the code is the documentation. :)
</p>
<p>
	I strongly advise the usage of original documentation of the MCUs and modules, because of possible faults in this tool. Possibly many faults.
</p>
<p>
	I've started this as a project for myself, so didn't really bother documenting it, but I'll do that.
