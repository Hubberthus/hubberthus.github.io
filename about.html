				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p>
					My name is Norbert Fekete.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm just a computer programmer who happens to like playing with microcontrollers. I'm in no way connected to Espressif and those creating modules for the ESP32 SoC.
				</p>
				<p>
					I work as a developer at an international company, and this page is just one of my hobby projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started to do all this for myself, but decided to share with the community. Maybe it can help out others as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is completely free and open-source. Feel free to copy, but please put my name somewhere if you put your version somewhere. 
				</p>
				<h3>Why?</h3>
				<p>
					Before I bought my first ESP32 module, I looked deep into the documentation, and a bit into the source of the ESP-IDF. 
				</p>
				<p>
					At first I was completely blown away by its rich contents. Then I realized that setting up a project for this chip will be a challenge.
					It has so many peripherals with overlapping pins, and then there is the GPIO matrix which is a powerful tool, and moves complicated to a whole new level. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For ESP8266 I've been using the Arduino core, but it was clear for me that the ESP32 will be a lot harder to do as an Arduino.
					It's not impossible, just not the best idea. Sure, there are many libraries for the Arduino, and those who prefer that I understand.
					But if we want its full potential, then the ESP-IDF is the good choice.
				</p>
				<p>
					And after choosing the ESP-IDF over Arduino I was scratching my head, how to choose the right pinout settings for my projects?
					What if I would like to change somethig a bit and that needed changing the whole setup? And I need to be aware of the input-only pins.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is when I saw my brother use the STM32Cube, and that was the spark for this all. Love at fist sight, that what what I needed. I won't deny it, this is a kind-of copy with some modifications. And made as a website, rather than a program.
				</p>
				<h3>Why a website?</h3>
				<p>
					It is kind of cross-platform and you don't need to download anything. Just have a recent browser, select your module, and start playing with pin settings. 
				</p>
				<h3>The functionality .... is missing/wrong!</h3>
				<p>
					I try to do my best, according to the documentation and my knowledge of things. There are many holes and messed up stuff. I hope I'll get some help to get this as accurate as it can be.
				</p>
				<h3>I can do an invalid setup!</h3>
				<p>
					Sanity check is on the TODO list.
				</p>
				<h3>The module ... is missing!</h3>
				<p>
					Same as the above. Trying to do my best in adding more and more modules so everybody can setup according to what they have.
				</p>
				<h3>I would like to save what I've done. Why is it resetting always?</h3>
				<p>
					Save/load functionality is on the TODO list.
				</p>
				<h3>Do you plan on implementing automatic code generation?</h3>
				<p>
					Oh yes! It's just it will be hard to do. But with generated code it can create a virtual layer, and when the pinout changes I won't need to change a single line in my application code.
